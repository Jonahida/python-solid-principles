# SOLID Principles in Python

This repository provides Python implementations of the **SOLID** principles, a set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software systems easier to maintain, extend, and understand.

The principles are as follows:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Each principle is demonstrated with both **bad** and **good** code examples, showing how adhering to SOLID can lead to more maintainable and flexible code.

## Running the Project

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonahida/python-solid-principles
cd solid-principles-python
```

### 2. Run the interactive example viewer:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will allow you to explore and compare bad and good implementations for each SOLID principle.

## The SOLID Principles Explained

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."*

The SRP suggests that a class should only have one job or responsibility. If a class has more than one responsibility, those responsibilities become coupled, which can lead to challenges when trying to change or extend the functionality.

**Example**:

- **Bad**: A `User` class handling both user data and file handling operations.

- **Good**: Separate classes for managing user data and handling file I/O operations.

---

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

*"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification."*

This principle promotes the idea of extending an existing class or moduleâ€™s behavior without modifying its code. Instead of changing existing code, we add new functionality by extending or composing new components.

**Example**:

- **Bad**: Modifying a class each time new functionality is needed.

- **Good**: Using inheritance, interfaces, or composition to add new behaviors without altering existing code.

---

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

*"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."*

The LSP ensures that subclasses are extensions of the parent class that behave as expected. Subtypes should be able to replace their base types without causing issues.


**Example**:

- **Bad**: A `Rectangle` class being subclassed into a `Square` class that violates the expected behavior.

- **Good**: `Square` class should not extend `Rectangle`; instead, both should implement a shared interface.

---

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

*"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."*

The ISP advises breaking down large, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. Clients should only implement interfaces that are relevant to them.


**Example**:

- **Bad**: A `Worker` interface requiring `work()` and `eat()` methods, where `Robot` doesn't need `eat()`.

- **Good**: Separate interfaces for `Workable` and `Eatable`, so clients only implement what they need.

---

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

*"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."*

This principle suggests that both high-level and low-level modules should rely on abstractions (e.g., interfaces), not concrete implementations, promoting flexibility and decoupling in the system.


**Example**:

- **Bad**: A `Project` class directly depending on `BackendDeveloper` and `FrontendDeveloper`.

- **Good**: Using an abstraction like `Developer` so that `Project` can work with any type of developer.

## The `main.py` Script

The `main.py` script allows you to interactively explore and compare bad and good examples of each SOLID principle. It includes the following features:

1. **Interactive Menu**: The script presents a menu with the following options:

- 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- 6. Exit

2. **Code Examples**: When a principle is selected, the script will display:

- **Bad Example**: Code that violates the SOLID principle.

- **Good Example**: Code that follows the SOLID principle.

3. **Simple Navigation**: Choose a principle from the menu to see its examples, and exit the program when you're done.
